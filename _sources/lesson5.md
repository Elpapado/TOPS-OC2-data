# Lesson 5: Planning for Open Data

## Introduction
In the previous lessons it has been shown that effective open data needs to be managed. As we have seen this is not trivial and requires work and preparation. Correspondingly, there can be cost implications for your institutions to do this. Rather than facing these issues on an ad hoc basis, one should plan and prepare what you will need to do before you generate the data. With this in mind, we will 

* discuss the data life cycle which places a focus on the reuse of data as it is generated.
* Introduce the concept of a data management plan, where one documents the steps that will be carried out to ensure that your data can be shared in an appropriate fashion.
* Introduce the concept of metadata, namely documenting your data which is essential if another researcher is to make use of your data.
* Finally, who to contact in terms of advice and support. 
### 5.1 Planning
#### The data life cycle
With a focus on generating papers, a researcher implicitly ended up with the following research workflow model in mind of how they worked with their data.
It’s important to note here that because the focus is on the paper, there’s no thought to how the data changes at different stages of the process, or thought to how the data should be managed after a paper is published. Usually the data were included as part of the paper as a supplementary file. 
This can be summarized in the following image.

On the other hand, if one thinks of open data that can be FAIR (and thus reused) then this model emerges. In particular that
Data needs to be available beyond the publication of a paper.
Data no longer has to be associated with one paper.
Data can be reanalysed.
More data, from different sources or the same lab, can be added in at any time, including later.
Instead of the process being a linear progression, with a start and a finish, the process for data becomes more complex and there is cycle.
These ideas were put together in the [DCC Curation Lifecycle model](http://www.ijdc.net/article/view/69) [1]. The original life cycle is complicated but a summary of the life-cycle is listed below

Here the focus is very much moved away from the idea of research -> publication and instead is on the data itself as a first class research output.
Let’s look at these individual steps
**Plan**: a description of the data that will be compiled, how the data will be managed and made accessible throughout its lifetime.
**Collect**: this corresponds to the data gathering step (illustrated in Figure 5.1).  It can include both primary (raw) and processed data.
**Assure**: the quality of the data is assured through checks and inspections.
**Describe**: data is accurately and thoroughly described through documentation (e.g. metadata).
**Preserve**: these are the steps necessary to make sure that the data will be accessible going forward so in particular ensuring that the data is stored in a fashion that others can use it (in particular storing at a data repository). Ideally this should be done in a fashion that matches the CARE and FAIR principles (lesson 4). This may also include the step of removing data that may not be of use to future researchers. For example, high resolution images may no longer be themselves useful if in the analysis step one has extracted the features of interest from them. Not storing the high resolution image and simply storing the feature data would provide a considerable saving of storage.
Discover: here other researchers can extract either the entirety or some subset of the data for their own purposes.
**Integrate**: data from disparate sources are combined to form one homogeneous set of data that can be readily analyzed (this could include this one data set being analyzed).
**Analyze**: corresponds to the data analysis step as illustrated in Figure 5.1.
There are a variety of different interpretations of the data life-cycle (see the reading list for this lesson) with varying degrees of complexity. It’s also important to note that this is an idealization of what goes in general. Nonetheless, it is important to think of all these steps as an ongoing, interactive process that requires thorough planning and continued consideration and to recognize that they are non-trivial to do.
