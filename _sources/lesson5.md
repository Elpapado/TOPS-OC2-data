# Lesson 5: Planning for Open Data

## Introduction
In the previous lessons it has been shown that effective open data needs to be managed. As we have seen this is not trivial and requires work and preparation. Correspondingly, there can be cost implications for your institutions to do this. Rather than facing these issues on an ad hoc basis, one should plan and prepare what you will need to do before you generate the data. With this in mind, we will 

* discuss the data life cycle which places a focus on the reuse of data as it is generated.
* Introduce the concept of a data management plan, where one documents the steps that will be carried out to ensure that your data can be shared in an appropriate fashion.
* Introduce the concept of metadata, namely documenting your data which is essential if another researcher is to make use of your data.
* Finally, who to contact in terms of advice and support. 
### 5.1 Planning
#### The data life cycle
With a focus on generating papers, a researcher implicitly ended up with the following research workflow model in mind of how they worked with their data.
It’s important to note here that because the focus is on the paper, there’s no thought to how the data changes at different stages of the process, or thought to how the data should be managed after a paper is published. Usually the data were included as part of the paper as a supplementary file. 
This can be summarized in the following image.
