## Introduction
As mentioned earlier, data is a major part of scientific research, and why wouldn’t it be? It is evident that data permeates many aspects of our daily life with significant consequences.

For instance, it has become all the more common to see news articles discussing how data and efforts like [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.us/)  are critical in supporting the disaster emergency responses all over the world [1](https://www.openstreetmap.us/). This is only an example among many others demonstrating the value of data, particularly open and public data, in our daily life and for public good.

Similarly, data shared openly in scientific research brings tremendous value which is not limited to the scientific community but extends to communities at large from indigenous communities to urban populations! Before we look further into this, let’s first look at what is data in scientific fields? What is open data? What are the key characteristics of open data?
