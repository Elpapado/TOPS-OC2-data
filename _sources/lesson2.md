# Lesson 2: Benefits of Open Data 
## Introduction
In this lesson, weâ€™ll discuss the benefits of open data and in particular its direct effect in advancing Open Science. We will also discuss details of how Open Data can impact the response of science in global emergencies, and how Open Data facilitates multidisciplinary work.

### 2.1 Open Data for the greater good
As we mentioned earlier, data plays a significant role in our day-to-day lives. Open Data, in particular, has played a key role. If you pause and think about it, you may realize that Open Data is not only common in our society, but you might have benefited from it and used it yourself. 

Here, are some notable examples of Open Data that has positively impacted society at large:

```{admonition} Census survey data
Each country or territory often provides open access to a variety of socioeconomic information about the population, community, and business in its jurisdiction. These data are often called census survey data which may include the aggregated statistics of gender, race, ethnicity, education, income, and health data of a community. These data are often used to understand the composition of a local neighborhood and are critical to inform decisions on resource allocation to ensure the quality of life for the community.
